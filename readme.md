# Exercise​ ​3​ ​-​ ​Javascript
Implement a calendar app using HTML, Javascript and CSS.


Create only the browser-side code. You don't need to worry about persisting the user changes to a
server. It's okay if the page is loaded with an empty calendar and all changes are lost when the
page is refreshed.



In the very least, the app should:
- Show the current month
- Allow the user to store an event for a particular day
- Allow the user to view the event/events for a day.




The visual aspect, user interaction, and any additional features are up for you to decide. Please
note: the purpose of the task is to show off your skills in the development of applications. Please do
not use libraries that already implement a full calendar (such as FullCalendar.io). Other than that,
please feel free to use any libraries that allow you to abstract smaller tasks (such as date/time
parsing or DOM manipulation).
Have fun!
